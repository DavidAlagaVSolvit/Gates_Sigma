    <h4>Step 4: Define Characteristics and Reach of Fixed Immunization Locations </h4>
    <p>
      To calculate vaccine demand select a Immunization Location Catchment Area Radius and Expected Percentage Coverage with the drop down buttons. The Catchment radius is the distance reachable by fixed immunization locations for example 1,5,10 km. The Coverage Percentage for example, 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, allows the user to specify assumptions of how many people are vaccinated in each catchment area. Change Catchment Area and Percentage Coverage for each administrative area and the application will display the total number of people covered by fixed immunization locations based on these characteristics.
