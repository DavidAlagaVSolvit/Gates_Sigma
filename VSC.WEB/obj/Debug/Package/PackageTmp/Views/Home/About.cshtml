                    The Strategic Immunization Geotemporal Mapping Application (SIGMA) was a concept plan envisioned by the VSolvit Team as an opportunity to truly make a difference to improve the health and well-being of those most vulernable. We are a small piece of the overall community, but believe we can be an integral part of a global team that is dedicated to improving global health. SIGMA is represented in the below system diagram. SIGMA allows users to generate reports on existing immunization strategies, including successes and insufficiencies, that helps planning and testing potential solutions.

                                    Gridded Population of the World, Version 3 (GPWv3) consists of estimates of human population for the years 1990, 1995, and 2000 by 2.5 arc-minute grid cells and associated data sets dated circa 2000. A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing more than 300,000 national and sub-national administrative units, is used to assign population values to grid cells. The population density grids are derived by dividing the population count grids by the land area grid and represent persons per square kilometer. GPWv3 is produced by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) in collaboration with Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

                                    The actual coverage and future coverage map from the Sonitel website was the reference for the data collection. The cities and towns located on that map were already labeled according to a map legend that was included. The locations on the map were input into Google Maps to generate a coordinate point. They were then recorded in the spreadsheet and given a classification, (e.g Transmission Center.) The DOMSAT satellites were searched for on Google Maps by scanning the relative location in order to give an exact coordinate for the DOMSAT satellites. If they weren't found, it was recorded in the spreadsheet. The major cable infrastructures were switch networks and Centers of Transmission.  There were 13 cities detailed information could not be found. This list includes the following: Aderbissanat, Badaguichiri, Bandjo, Barwherie, Beikankanda, Belka, Bolcladie, Karama, Kote Kotha, Marigouna, Matseka, Ptarkanasso, Takeita.

If there was a match, Coordinates were recorded. If no match, the Stadium/Arena was searched through Google and Wikipedia to determine coordinates. Those coordinates were input into Google Maps to see if it was valid. If Coordinates were not found, coordinates of the city the stadium/arena is located in are displayed instead. There were three instances were city coordinates were used and they were for stadiums with capacity of 5,000 (the smallest) Birni'n Konni, Gaya, and Tillabery.

The B&B's and Inns were found in the same manor and cross referenced in Google. There were only 4 facilities classified as B&B's or Inns to be cross-verified on Google Maps (Guest House, Larewa, Tabakady, and Quartie Le Terminus) the rest of the coordinates were used from the city location given by Google. The addresses provided were listed by TripAdvosor or on the facility’s own website.

The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population. This data was collected from CIA World Fact Book and other databases linked to their source like Index Mundi. The ratio or percentage was applied to the population grid count file to develop an estimated demographics variable for each year per square kilometer. It was assumed the most statistics would not fluctuate significantly over the time period when they were collected to-day.

                                    The numbers of pregnant women was calculated by multiplying the fertility rate times the number of women of birthing population for each year, this value was then applied to the population grid count file to represent the number of women pregnant per square kilometer. The fertility rate gives a figure for the average number of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for population change in the country. A rate of two children per woman is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting in relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining. Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for families, in some situations, to feed and educate their children and for women to enter the labor force. Rates below two children indicate populations decreasing in size and growing older. Global fertility rates are in general decline and this trend is most pronounced in industrialized countries, especially Western Europe, where populations are projected to decline dramatically over the next 50 years.

                                    This variable represents the number of women per square kilometer that are birthing in each location. The data was collected from on article on End Fistula.com. The source quotes “Eighty-five per cent of women deliver at home, either unassisted or without the help of a trained provider. Entrenched traditions sometimes prevent women from leaving their homes, which may explain why only 30 per cent seek antenatal care and the C-section rate is 2 per cent. In addition, women are invariably encouraged to deliver their first child at the home of their parents, which can result in especially problematic situations when women live in remote areas far from obstetric care.” 2002
