===========
The Strategic Immunization Geotemporal Mapping (SIGMA) is a freely available and easy to use web based application that will help various decision makers:
1.  Forecast temporal demand for different vaccines in a country, in different parts of the country, and for each immunization location. 
2.	Determine the number and characteristics of women and children that are reachable and not reachable by current immunization locations and strategies in any given country.
3.	Plan the locations and operating characteristics of various immunization strategies (e.g., outreach, campaigns, and other hybrid strategies) that are needed to supplement the fixed immunization locations.
4.	Estimate the costs and cost-effectiveness of different immunization strategies.
5.	Demonstrate how robust these answers and solutions are to varying conditions (e.g., population migration, birth rates, compliance with immunization).
